# Recursive-Implementation-of-a-Feed-Forward-Neural-Network
A simple neural network with forward and back-propagation implemented using recursion.

This code implements a simple feed-forward neural network. However, the forward and backpropagation steps are
implemented as a single recursive function and the stack as a cache for all the values required in these steps
as opposed to using a separate data structure such as a list of dictionary.
